AFR cauge...just demo to lsu 4.9 wideband lambda.
My friend has some problem with his cars AFR cauge so I decaded to built some demo from scratch and with basic components like esp32, transistors, resistors and so on... that shows something, I know that lambda heater circuit need further thinking and so on, and this is far from correct way to build it...but anyway don't try this at home.This is just demo and i update this repo when project goes on further.

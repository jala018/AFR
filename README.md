# AFR
AFR gauge...just demo to lsu 4.9 wideband lambda.
My friend has some problem with his cars AFR gauge so I decaded to built some demo from scratch and with basic components like esp32, transistors, resistors and so on... that shows something, I know that the lambda heater circuit needs further thinking and so on, and this is far from correct way to build it...but anyway don't try this at home.This is just demo and I update this repo when project goes on further.And I am not sure yet about that esp32 because this is just demo so probably could change to arduino uno
